# Chapter 1

## Double Up Food Bucks 

---

### Research Question

&gt; How effective is the DUFB financial incentive at increasing the fresh fruits and vegetables purchased by SNAP shoppers within a grocery store environment?

--

### Hypotheses

- A small increase (2 - 5%) in SNAP EBT expenditures on fruits and vegetables (FVs) during the months the DUFB incentive is active in the experimental stores (Aug - Dec).
- No significant differences in FV expenditures during the months the incentive is not in effect (Jan - July).
- The state's SNAP benefit schedule will affect when differences are detected. Difference, if found, will be detected during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks, fading during the 4th week.

### Motivation

- High consumption of unhealthy foods, low consumption of fruits and vegetables
- Overtime, poor diet leads to adverse health outcomes
- Chronic diet-related diseases are expensive
- US government could save lives and money by improving diets

--

### Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

- Anti-hunger program, not a nutrition program
- Currently, few restrictions on what can be purchased with SNAP benefits
- Substantial overlap between families participating in SNAP and Medicaid/Medicare
- These programs are expensive
    - SNAP — $74 billion FY2015
    - Medicare — $646.2 billion FY2015
    - Medicaid - $545.1 billion FY2015

*Possible to save money by improving the diet of SNAP beneficiaries.*

---

### Double Up Food Bucks (DUFB)

- Financial incentive program targetting SNAP beneficiaries
- Doubles purchasing power for FVs up to $20/day
- Dollars (points) are earned buying local fresh produce
- Can then be redeemed on *any* eligible produce

--

### Data

- 3 years of sales data from 32 stores (17 treated, 15 control)
- Sales data includes UPC, price, tender, time, etc.
- **Status**: Testing transfer options.

--

### Known and Expected Data Challenges

1. Purchases not linked to customers
2. Outcome Variable with non-trivial amount of zeros (corner solutions)
3. Consumers maximize across multiple product types

---

### Methods

All cross-sectional.

1. Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences
2. Hurdle Models
3. Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value

--

### Unobserved Individual Effects?

*Working on it.*

- Assume shoppers fall into types 
  - but also assume shopper type is dynamic
- Determine shopper types via clustering using 
  - shopping basket composition
  - time/day of purchase

# Chapter 2

## Durham Connects &amp; Request for Social Services

---

### Research Question: 

&gt; For families that participated in the Durham Connects pilot program, did the intervention (information and nurse contact) impact the future probability of applying for social services?

--

### Hypothesis

- Expect to observed a larger proportion of families that participated in Durham Connects requesting social services. 
- Hypothesis is that the information and nurse contact provided to DC families decreased the complexity of applying and navigating the social safety net. 
- DC families are observed more frequently not because they are, on average, in greater need of assistance, but because they have been informed, encouraged, and enabled to seek out available resources.

---

### Take-Up Rate

&gt; Percentage of eligible individuals receiving benefits.

--

### Take-Up Rate can be reduced by

- Stigma
- Onerous application process
- Confusion, misunderstanding, misinformation

### Frameworks

- **Neoclassical**: rational, complete information
  - Gap explained by *stigma* and other costs.
- **Bounded Rationality**: incomplete information, hueristics, status quo bias

# Chapter 3

## SNAP and Off-Cycle Demand for Assistance

---

### Research Question

&gt; Do request for additional assistance increase during the off-cycles of a household SNAP benefit schedules?

### Hypothesis

- Expect, in aggregate, an increase towards the last 2 weeks of the month following SNAP benefit transfers. 
- That is, I expect to reject the null hypothesis that, in aggregate, request for formal assistance are randomly distributed between transfer dates.
